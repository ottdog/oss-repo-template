For an open source project, having an open source license is important because without a license, it's assumed the original author of the code has copyright. Default copyright law doesn't allow for redistribution, modification, or use in every context, which makes it incompatable with open source.

4. You should not use a project without an explicit license because without one it defaults to default copyright law. This gives the original author the copyright and the potential to sue you in the future for using their code.

5. I partially agree that failure to follow open systems protocol contributed to the web beating Gopher. I recall Mosaic being a popular web browser because it was free to the end user in an era where people had to pay for web browsers. If Gopher came out as free before Mosaic, it could've gathered a large portion of users just by being free of charge, and then having the advantage over Mosaic by also being open source. However, being free and first doesn't gaurentee success. Microsoft Edge is a free web browser that comes default with any new install of Windows, but everyone ditches it for Chrome or Firefox almost immediately (Chrome being propitary software). Mosaic could still have outcompeted Gopher by providing a better user experience.

6. Based on the linked Wikipedia article, Sailfish OS was a propitary OS developed for Jolla phones and tablets. To me, I can see a justification to keep it closed source because for most users, the only thing really distinguishing one phone from another is the operating system's user experience. By making the operating system open source, that allows competitors in the hardware space use Sailfish on their own products, which would take away any competitive advantage Jolla would have had in the software realm and force them to compete only on providing better hardware for less.
