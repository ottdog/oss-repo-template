Two additonal suggestions to answer questions helpfully:

  -Explaining why an answer is what it is can help out a lot when it seems an asker has a conceptual misunderstanding. Clearing up a conceptual misunderstanding will help the original asker and people reading the thread later solve similar problems on their own and reduce future need for similar questions.
  
  -Always try to maintain at least a neurtal tone when answering questions. Not only do agressive tones scare people away, but humans tend to match the energy of what others around them are doing and eventually you're going to be the one asking your community questions. Try to set a good example.
  
2-4:

I've taken away multiple things from this reading. First, from a practical perspective, if I plan on doing anything that could possibly anger the RIAA, I should plan on giving any assests I have to someone else first to reduce the amount they can ask for in a settlement. More importantly, from a philosophical perspective, a strong case can be made that the current American copyright system is broken. Ideally, we'd want a system that encourages creativity and innovation as that generally tends to improve people's quality of life. However here we have a case where a corperation used the legal code to actively punish someone for making life easier for the thousands of people at his university. <Make more coherent point later>
