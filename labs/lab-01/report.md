Two additonal suggestions to answer questions helpfully:

  -Explaining why an answer is what it is can help out a lot when it seems an asker has a conceptual misunderstanding. Clearing up a conceptual misunderstanding will help the original asker and people reading the thread later solve similar problems on their own and reduce future need for similar questions.
  
  -Always try to maintain at least a neurtal tone when answering questions. Not only do agressive tones scare people away, but humans tend to match the energy of what others around them are doing and eventually you're going to be the one asking your community questions. Try to set a good example.

I've taken away multiple things from this reading. First, from a practical perspective, if I plan on doing anything that could possibly anger the RIAA, I should plan on giving any assests I have to someone else first to reduce the amount they can ask for in a settlement. More importantly, from a philosophical perspective, a strong case can be made that the current American copyright system is broken. Ideally, we'd want a system that encourages creativity and innovation as that generally tends to improve people's quality of life. However here we have a case where a corperation used the legal code to actively punish someone for making life easier for the thousands of people at his university. From my own utilitarian perspective, this is rediculous. People should not be punished for making other people's lives bettr, and it especially shouldn't be done through our overtaxed, resource expensive legal system. I think this is another example I can point to in order to argue my position that intellectual property laws in general need a total overhaul.

My strategy for finding projects I would want to evaluate or work on is pretty simple. Over the past few years I've just come across a handful open source projects I found interesting and other problems I'd want to solve so for the most part I'm just reviewing my pre-existing list of projects/project ideas. The project I'd like to evaluate the most would likely be the [Darkflame Lego Universe Server Emulator.](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer) This is an open source project I've been following for a long time and directly beneifited from, so that could make it a good jumping off point for me to learn the ins and outs of open source. As for projects/problems, it'd be awesome if I could make the garden planning tool I'm already planning on desining for Software Design and Doccumentation open source and also use it in this class. However, I doubt I'll be allowed just use the same project for two classes, so I also have several alternative ideas such as my own virtual assistant project, several simple game ideas, and a system to suggest foods to eat based on what nutrients I haven't had a good amount of in a while.
